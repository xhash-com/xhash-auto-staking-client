# xhash-auto-staking-client

xhash-auto-staking-client is a fast staking program developed by XHash for eth2.0 staking on [XHash](https://www.xhash.com)(https://www.xhash.com).
It is modified based on the [Wagyu Key Gen](https://github.com/stake-house/wagyu-key-gen) which is the validators generator recommended by Ethereum.

Through this program, users can generate the validators, complete the deposit, upload the keystore file to XHash in one stop.
